        Well it isn't, it's actually quite fun to learn!

        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the essential language of the web (it acts as the container for the Website), 
        used to structure and display content on websites. It uses tags enclosed in angle 
        brackets to define elements like text, images, and links. 
        These elements create the structure of web pages and ensure they are displayed 
        correctly by web browsers. Whether you're making a simple webpage or a complex web application, 
        knowing HTML is crucial for anyone involved in web development or design.

        "<em>CSS </em>? Is this some sort of funky word or what?" No. <br>
        You know that feeling when you want to make yourself look nice?
        Well, a webpage needs a little help with that, call it a "Make-Up Artist for a Website" if you will.
      </h3>
      <p class="home-css-intro-par">
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes web content look good ("Make-Up for the Website-Container"). 
        It's used to change things like colors, fonts, and spacing on websites. 
        By writing rules for how elements should appear, CSS separates the design from the content (HTML),
        making it easier to make websites look great. Whether it's adjusting colors or creating layouts, 
        CSS is essential for making web pages visually appealing and user-friendly, making it a must-know 
        for web developers and designers.
